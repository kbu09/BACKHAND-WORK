# Differentiate between append () and extend () methods?
# Ans =

# 1. The add() method
#     adds a single item to the list's end.
#     The complete iterable is inserted as a single item (nested list, string, etc.) if the element is an iterable (such as a list).

#     List.append(element) is the syntax. 

#     adds the entire object as a single element, even if it is a string or list.

#     2. The extend() function
#     adds each component separately to the original list after unpacking the contents of the specified iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string).
#     doesn't produce lists with nests.

#     Syntax:

#     list.Individual entries from the iterable are added to the list using the extend(iterable) function.
