# What is the purpose continue statement in python? 

# Python's continue statement allows you to go to the next iteration of a loop without running the remaining code inside the current one. It is usually used inside loops (for or while) when you wish to continue with the loop's subsequent iteration while avoiding specific code segments based on a condition.

# purpose: The continue statement enables the loop to skip to the following iteration right away and disregard the remaining code in the loop's body for the current iteration.
