-- What is DDL Interpreter? 
-- Ans..

A database management system (DBMS) component that interprets and runs Data Definition Language (DDL) commands is called a DDL interpreter. Database objects like tables, views, indexes, and schemas can have their structures defined, changed, or managed using DDL statements.

Important DDL Input Commands:
CREATE: Produces a fresh database entity, such as a table or index.
ALTER: Changes a database object that already exists (e.g., adding a column to a table).
DROP: Removes an object from the database (e.g., removing a table).

Role of the DDL Interpreter:
Interpretation: DDL commands are read by the DDL interpreter, which then translates them into low-level instructions.
Execution: After that, it modifies the data dictionary, also known as the system catalogue, to reflect modifications made to the database structure.
Validation: The interpreter validates whether the commands are valid (e.g., checking that the object to be created doesn't already exist or that the object to be discarded does exist).

To put it briefly, the DDL Interpreter makes sure that modifications to the database's structure are appropriately handled and recorded in the system catalogue, enabling the DBMS to monitor and maintain the schema of the database.
