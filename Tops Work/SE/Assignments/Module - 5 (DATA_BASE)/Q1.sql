An easily accessible, manageable, and updated collection of organised data is called a database. Large volumes of structured data are stored in databases, which provide effective data management and querying.

Key concepts related to databases include:

Data: The actual information that is kept on file, including text, numbers, and pictures.
Tables: Data is kept in relational databases in tables made up of rows and columns. Every column denotes a field (attribute), and every row represents a record.
Software that assists users in creating, maintaining, and interacting with databases (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle) is known as a database management system (DBMS).
The language used to communicate with relational databases is called SQL (Structured Query Language). Users can query, add, update, and remove data with it.


Types of databases include:

Relational databases, such as MySQL and SQL Server, store data in tables with pre-established associations.
NoSQL databases, like MongoDB and Cassandra, are made for unstructured data and flexible schemas.
Databases kept in memory to facilitate quicker access to data (e.g., Redis).
Cloud databases: Stored on cloud computing platforms (like Amazon RDS) for scalability and accessibility.
