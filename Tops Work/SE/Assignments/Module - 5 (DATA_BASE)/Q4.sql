-- What is MF Cod Rule of RDBMS Systems? 
-- ANS...

The twelve standards (often referred to as Codd's 12 rules) established by E.F. Codd specify the requirements that a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) must fulfil in order to be deemed a genuine relational system.

Here is a condensed list of the guidelines:

1. Information Rule: Tables should be used to hold all data.

2. Every data element must be reachable by table, primary key, and column, according to the guaranteed access rule.

3. Methodical Handling of Null Values: Missing or unidentified data should be supported by the database.

4. Dynamic Online Catalogue: SQL should be used to store and query the database structure itself.

5. Rule for Comprehensive Data Sub-language: SQL must be supported by the system for all jobs (transactions, data administration, etc.).

6. Virtual tables, or views, ought to be able to be updated.

7. High-level Insert, Update, and Delete: SQL should be able to handle data in sets (bulk operations) in the database.

8. Physical Data Independence: How data is accessed shouldn't be impacted by changes in storage.

9. Logical Data Independence: Access to data shouldn't be impacted by modifications to a table's structure.

10. Integrity Independence: Application logic and integrity constraints, such as primary keys, should be kept apart.

11. Independence in Distribution: The user should not be aware of the data's geographical distribution.

12. Non-subversion Rule: Low-level access should not circumvent security or integrity regulations if it is permitted.
