// What is OOP ? List OOP concepts
// Ans..

A programming paradigm known as object - oriented programming(OOP)
arranges the design of software around data or objects as opposed to functions and logic.You can think of objects as actual things with characteristics and actions(functions or methods).

1. Objects and Classes :
   - Class: An object creation blueprint. It describes a data structure that has methods and characteristics.
   - Object: A class instance. It can carry out class-defined functions and has actual data.

2.  Encapsulation : - The idea of combining methods that manipulate data and data (attributes) into a single unit or class, with access to part of the object's components restricted to maintain regulated interaction.
                                                  
3.  Details:
   - Hiding intricate implementation details and displaying an object's essential features alone. By keeping things simple, complexity can be decreased.

4.  Heritage  :
   - A way by which a class (child or derived class) takes on traits and methods from a parent or base class, as well as other features and behaviours. Reusing code is encouraged by this.

5.  Transformation :
   - The capacity of several objects can react differently to an identical method call. Having numerous implementations for a single interface—typically accomplished through overloading or method overriding—allows for code flexibility.

6. Binding Dynamically:
the procedure that resolves a method call at runtime rather than compile time, enabling objects to choose the runtime method to invoke based on their real object type.
