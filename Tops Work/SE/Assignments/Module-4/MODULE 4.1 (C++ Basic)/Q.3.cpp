// What is the difference between OOP and POP ?
// Ans...

The main distinction between procedural - oriented programming(POP) and object - oriented programming(OOP)
is how they approach problem - solving and code organisation.This is how the two are contrasted:


1. Basic Concept:

OOP =
Objects and their interactions are the main topics of object-oriented programming, or OOP.
Programs are organised around objects, which are made up of methods (functions) and data (attributes).

POP =
Procedure-Oriented Programming, or POP:
focusses on methods or features.
Programs are organised around data-operating functions.


2. Key Components:

OOP:
Classes and objects make up the main parts.
Real-world entities are represented as objects, and classes specify their characteristics and actions.

POP:
Functions are the main constituents.
Functions exchange data and carry out distinct tasks.


3. Data and Functionality:

OOP:
Objects are collections of functions and data.
Data protection is ensured by encapsulation, which limits access to the object's methods.

POP:
Functions and data are distinct entities.
Data is less secure because it is sent to functions for processing and is more widely available.


4. Approach:

OOP:
employs a bottom-up methodology, emphasising the creation of reusable objects before moving on to the interaction of objects to develop systems.

POP:
employs a top-down method, segmenting an issue into smaller processes or functions and resolving each one in turn.


5. Reusability:

OOP:
Promotes code reusability through inheritance and polymorphism, where classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes.

POP:
Code is less reusable since functions are more independent, and there is no inheritance mechanism.


7. Examples:

OOP:
C++, Java, Python (when using objects and classes).

POP:
C, Fortran, Pascal.


8. Security:
OOP:
improves data security by encapsulating data, allowing it to be contained inside an object and kept secret.

POP:
Since data is frequently transferred between functions, it is more exposed and susceptible to unauthorised access.
